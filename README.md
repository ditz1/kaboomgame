# Socket.io Basic Fighting Game Implementation #
### ditz1 ###

Basic fighting game run through node and websockets. \
Controls: \
Move Left: A \
Move Right: D \
Jump: W \
Attack: Space \
**WIP** 

## To start server ##
- must have node.js  

>> git clone <repository>   

\> cd /path/to/repo/  \

>> node server.js \

On Browser: \

>> http://localhost:8080    

Players 1 and 2 must join for the game to start, \
and both players must **EXIT** the page in order to   
restart the game (again this is wip). 

Code uses localhost for demo, but replacing  
localhost with port forwarded ip will work  \
if the index.html is hosted on the same ip
